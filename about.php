                    <p>Hi, I’m Josel, a <strong>Web Designer</strong> in Vancouver, BC, Canada! <br><br>“Web Design” may have a definition to you already, but to me, web design is anything that is a design on the web. I love the work and thought process that goes into making our favorite websites! Even the browser you are using to view this now, so much time and effort went into making it the best it can be for the end user. Which I believe is <strong><i>why</i></strong> I design for the web.</p>

                        <h3>The Why!</h3>
                        <p>I’ve always been taught to put my mind in the reader’s perspective. At BCIT, we code or design for the end user in mind when building a project. The user is always “why” I create anything. The “why” is something that has stuck with me since the start of my career. I always question, “why-” is something like that, or “why-” does a design look like this. Questions really drive <i>why</i> I do something, because without the why, then why are you doing what you do!</p>

            <h4>Chess</h4>
            <p class="space-after">Pieces, one of my portfolio pieces may give it away that I love to play chess (here’s <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/gchess2222" target="_blank">my chess.com profile</a> if you ever want to play a game with me)! Chess has many benefits to playing it, like improving strategic and adaptive mindsets. As a strong problem solver, I enjoy every moment where you must respond to your opponents moves and find a solution to the problem at hand.</p>
            <h4>Fitness and Conditioning</h4>
            <p>With a healthy mind, you always need a healthy body! I've enjoyed working out ever since I was 9, but never had an extensive schedule until 2023 in high school. At this time, I took a fitness and conditioning course where I added more to my previous schedule. I was grateful for the experience as I further developed discipline and dedication.</p>
