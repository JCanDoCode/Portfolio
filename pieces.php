            <h3>Goal</h3>

            <h3>Narrative</h3>
            <p>In this project, I created my first responsive website that included, responsive elements, font sizes, and media queries. I chose the topic of a fictional company that sells chess boards.</p>

            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>First, I created the low fidelity layouts for mobile (575px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px) in Figma. Along with these, I created in illustrator the logo, wordmark, and gathered images from unsplash to use on the home page. These assets were all related to chess.</p>

            <h3>Draft Website</h3>
            <p>Now it was time to code the layouts made in Figma. I designed with the mobile first idea. This draft website was made responsive with media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop. This draft website had placeholder frames for where images would go in the final implementation. Another important thing on this website was the hamburger menu which I coded in JavaScript. After this stage, the real website would be filled with all the images and plugins needed.</p>

        <div>
            <pre><code class="language-css">
            .home-flex {
                width: 90%;
                height: 1300px;
                margin: 0 5% 0 5%;
                display: flex;
                flex-direction: column;
                align-items: center;
            }
            .wordmark {
                width: 100%;
                height: 15%;
                margin-bottom: 15px;
                background: url("../images/pieces_wordmark.png");
                background-position: center;
                background-size: contain;
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
            }
            .paragraph-image {
                margin-bottom: 5px;
            }
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <article>
            <h3>Final Website</h3>
            <p>To finish up the website, I added the images, a slider plugin, and removed css no longer used (due to the pluginâ€™s css). I noticed that the hamburger menu was sliding in too far when viewport width was below 300px. After altering the JavaScript transform value from px to vw, I could translate the hamburger menu according to its vw. This fixed my problem I was having.</p>
