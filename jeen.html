            <h2>JEEN</h2>
            <p>This project was focused on Project Management and teamwork. My team and I chose a fictional restaurant project with the name, JEEN. This name was created from the initials of our 4 group members, Josel, Eunsol, Emma, and Neal.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Create a high-end website for a bistro/restaurant called JEEN. This website will let users see the menu, find a location, order, and make a reservation</p>

            <h3>Narrative</h3>
            <p>This project was focused on Project Management and teamwork. We were put in random groups and were given a choice of topics we could do. We chose a restaurant project with the name, JEEN. This name was created from the initials of our 4 group members, Josel, Eunsol, Emma, and Neal. To stay organized, each week we would have agile scrum meetings to assign and discuss what we would do that week.</p>

            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>In this phase we created the user stories and brand identity. Our brand identity was to appeal to middle-high class clientele. This clientele would be people looking to eat somewhere fancy without breaking the bank. To achieve this demographic, we used gold on navy as our color scheme. We also chose photos that complement our color scheme. In the end, we created 20 user stories, a mood board, logo, inspiration links, and written content that would be on the website. User stories were helpful in deciding who and why someone uses the website.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Then, we designed the low fidelity wireframes for the website. Figma was a great app to use with a team since we could edit in real time with others. I was tasked with creating the menu page. One of the problems I was faced with here was to create a luxurious feel to the website. Something that occurred in most real-world examples were the abstract ways of conveying messages through abstract elements. I solved this problem by adding sleek lines under the price to create this concept.</p>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>Neal and I coded the website while Eunseol and Emma worked on the user flows of the reservation and order process. We were not aware of responsiveness yet, so these pages were created with static units.</p>

            <h3>Launch</h3>
            <p>Now the JEEN team presented the website to the client. After the website was a success, we launched it on Neals domain.<br><br>Overall, every team member played a part and worked efficiently together. Another thing to note is that we all had a chance to be a product manager since we cycled the role weekly.</p>
